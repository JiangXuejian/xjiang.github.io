##### MALATANG (MApping the dense moLecular gAs in the sTrongest stAr-formiNg Galaxies)



![MALATANG-150x150](images/MALATANG-150x150.png)

- The scientific goals of MALATANG

  Resolved dense gas star formation relations
  
  especially at Intermediate scales/luminosities
  
  diagnose the SF properties in different environments: nuclear vs. disk
  
  obtain the radial distribution of dense gas and SF efficiency

- I am actively working on one of the JCMT large program MALATANG, dealing with observerving preparation, data reduction, telecon orgnization and project Wiki maintanence:

- **Status**

  The observations has been completed in 2017, and the overall sensitivity came out as we expected; But the signals of most of the galaxies are much weaker than predicted. Affected by ozone features NGC 1097 and NGC 1365 were non-detections in either HCN or HCO+ line. HCN was not detected in NGC 2146, NGC 2903 & NGC 3521.

##### CCH in the ISM (Astrochemistry)**

- I am particularly interested in the new and open topic: Astrochemistr, because chemistry is a new way to understand the composition, properties of the interstellar medium, hence the secret of star formation.
