# PDFchem example:

## Orion A (Jiang et al. 2024 submitted)

The processed results of Orion A are better illustrated on web pages instead of a journal PDF. On the below we show two kinds of PDFchem results. 

## [Collective Figures](https://jiangxuejian.github.io/PDFchem/collective.html)

When one click one cutout which representing one small regions of Orion A, a collective figures of corresponding result of possible solutions for various species will show on the right of the page. For example, the HI/H2 ratio, abundances of CI, CII, CO etc., the brightness temperature ratio of CI (1-0)/CO (1-0), [CII]/CO (1-0), etc.

## [T (CO 1-0) solutions](https://jiangxuejian.github.io/PDFchem/Tco10.html)

When you click one cutout which representing one small regions of Orion A, a figure of the corresponding result of possible solutions the brightness temperature of CO (1-0) will show on the right of the page. A solid magenta line is also overlaid, where it is available, to show the actual brightness temperature of CO (1-0) from observations (Kong et al. 2008). It is then used to constrain the solution for FUV and cosmic ray ionization rate.
