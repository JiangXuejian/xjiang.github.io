- ### About me

  I am working in Purple Mountain Observatory, Chinese Academy of Sciences (Nanjing). I got my Ph.D in the School of Astronomy and Space Science, Nanjing University in 2014, and now I use radio/millimeter telescopes to observe and study the properties of Interstellar Medium (ISM) and star formation in the Milky Way and nearby galaxies. I am particularly interested in astrochemistry and currently I am studying hydrocarbon molecular lines in both Milky Way star forming regions and nearby star formign galaxies.
