- ### About me

  I am an Astronomer working at the Research Center for Astronomical Computing, Zhejiang Laboratory, Hangzhou, China. I used to work at the JCMT/East Asian Observatory (Hilo, Hawaii) as a EAO Fellow. I got my Ph.D in the School of Astronomy and Space Science, Nanjing University in 2014, and now I use radio/millimeter telescopes to observe and study the properties of Interstellar Medium (ISM) and star formation in the Milky Way and nearby galaxies. I am particularly interested in astrochemistry and currently I am developing a novel method that can combine observational molecular line data with astrochemical models to reveal the properties of  carbon species in both Milky Way star-forming regions and nearby star-forming galaxies.
